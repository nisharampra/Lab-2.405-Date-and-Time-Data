    "In this notebook you will find a few examples of how to manipulate date and time data using Python's standard [`datetime`](https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/datetime.html) and [`pytz`](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pytz) libraries. We will pretty much be dealing with libraries through the entirety of the course. They make our lives easier and give us access to lots of powerful features."
